# safetytracker_houston

Under-development safety tracker providing near-real-time crime data by neighborhood in a resident-friendly format that helps people see changes in major types of crimes citywide and in individual areas of the city over the last 12 months and in recent years.

The data for the project comes directly from the Houston Police Department's public incident data, including its annual archive data, monthly year to date data and its most recent 30 days GIS data feeds. Boundaries for police beats and descriptions of the rough areas and landmarks within them come directly from the Houston Police Department's web site and GIS data. Population estimates for those areas are calculated based on data from the 2020 Census.

Mortality risk data come from the CDC's data for Harris County and Texas.
